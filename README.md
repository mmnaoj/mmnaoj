Currently learning to become a kind of fullstack programmer basically now focused on javascript, 
after having worked with Python and JupyterNotebook. Also enthusiast of Blockchain and Dapps, 
this will be the next goal in my agenda. I'm the kind of person that never ends the degrees, 
the institutions doesn't usually fit on my own ethos, it always ends in crisis. 
Started IT Engineering, and Economics (on halt). 

Knowledge should be open and free, to guarantee opportunities for all for those who don't have the means. 

I can't stand people with too many EGO. Cheers.
